# Exploits Used 

## Exploitation: NMap/WPScan

### The vulnerability was exploited by using Nmap command to get the ip addresses and to scan open ports on the network. 

     Command: nmap -sP 192.168.1.1-255

   #The "sP" command, also known as the skip ports scan, was used to find only the hosts that responded to the "ping scan".

    Command: nmap -sV --script-vulners -v 192.168.1.110

  #This enumeration scan was used for vulnerability detection, backdoor detection, vulnerability exploitation, and network discovery.

    Command: nmap -sV 192.168.1.110

  #Using Nmap "sV" option you are able to view open ports on the network

By using the nmap command, it enumerated the open ports, services and machine names. Target 1 machine -  open port 22  ssh open- ssh and port 80 http Apache.  The exploit granted an attack on target site http://192.168.1.110.  

     Command:  wpscan --url http://192.168.1.110/wordpress -eu

## Exploitation: Brute Force

Summarize of Actions:
1. After WPScan had enumerated two user accounts, ‘michael’ and ‘steven’ we attempted to gain access to either account by guessing passwords

- Steven’s password proved to be unlikely to guess, while Michael’s password was very simple

- Early guesses were ‘password’ or ‘123456’

- michael's password being "michael"

2. Using ssh we were able to login as michael.

          Command: ssh michael@192.168.1.110

- Being now logged in as michael, SqL querying becomes accessible for querying and reading the database for more information.
3. First find the paswword and name of the sql database in a configuration file named var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
           
          
          
After finding the password the following commnd is prompted to gain access to mysql:    
          
          Command: mysql -u root -p


Calling the name of the sql databse allows us to use the
